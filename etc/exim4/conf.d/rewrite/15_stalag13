# E rewrite all envelope fields
# F rewrite the envelope From field
# T rewrite the envelope To field
# b rewrite the 'Bcc:' header
# c rewrite the 'Cc:' header
# f rewrite the 'From:' header
# h rewrite all headers
# r rewrite the 'Reply-To:' header
# s rewrite the 'Sender:' header
# t rewrite the 'To:' header
# Anyway check RFC822 for details on fields and headers

# Use /usr/sbin/exim -brw user@host to test the rewriting rules

# For example, flags EFbcfhrs specify that the rewriting rule
# apply to all headers except the 'To:' header.

#
# THE RULES ARE SCANNED IN ORDER, and replacements from earlier
# rules can themselves be replaced as a result of later rules
# (see also q and R flags).

# We dont deal with deprecated domains automatically so old address
# being still used are noticed (could even be tagged)

# specific catchalls that should be kept as they are
