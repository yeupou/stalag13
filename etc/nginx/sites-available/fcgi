# These are example to activate Perl and/or PHP fastcgi
# You can include this file within your intranet setup with:
#           include sites-available/fcgi;
# Since it involves security, it's recommended however to edit or
# copy and paste just what you need.


# PHP apps with spawn-fcgi for any .php files anywhere: ~ .php$
# You may want instead to use more defined location like
#        ^/sysinfo/(.*)\.php$
# Especially some users can upload files to directories within the server root
location ~ .php$ {
  # allow only local for starters
  include allow_local;
  deny all;
  include fastcgi.conf;
  fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
  fastcgi_index  index.php;
}

# Perl apps with spawn-fcgi for any .pl files anywhere: ~ .pl$
# You may want instead to use more defined location like
#        /sysadmin/index.pl
# Especially some users can upload files to directories within the server root
location ~ .pl$ {
  # allow only local for starters
