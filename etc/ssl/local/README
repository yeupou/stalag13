It is probably best to generate/move certificates in
   /etc/ssl/local
to share them easily among daemons and to put in
   /etc/nginx/certs
   /etc/dovecot/certs
   ...
only symlinks.

The makecert.sh script from /etc/ssl/local should generate decent enough
self-signed certificates.

For the record, at the moment (2014 April) it's recommended to rely only on
TLS and deactivate SSLv3, SSL2, etc.
