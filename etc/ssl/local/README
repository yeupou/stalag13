It is probably best to generate/move certificates in
   /etc/ssl/local
to share them easily among daemons and to put symlinks to it as
   /etc/nginx/certs
   /etc/dovecot/certs
   /etc/exim4/exim.crt
   /etc/exim4/exim.key
   ...

The makecert.sh script from /etc/ssl/local should generate decent enough
self-signed certificate:
     .crt + .key
     .pem as symlink to .crt
     .der as der encoded version (sometimes necessary)

Some daemon (exim4) need read access to the certs. In this case, it's possible to use the special group ssl-cert
     adduser Debian-exim ssl-cert
     chgrp ssl-cert /etc/ssl/local/domain...
     chmod g+r /etc/ssl/local/domain...


For the record, at the moment (2014 April) it's recommended to rely only on
TLS and deactivate SSLv3, SSL2, etc.
