It is probably best to generate/move certificates in
   /etc/ssl/local
to share them easily among daemons and to put symlinks to it as
   /etc/nginx/certs
   /etc/dovecot/certs
   /etc/exim4/exim.crt
   /etc/exim4/exim.key
   ...

The makecert.sh script from /etc/ssl/local should generate decent enough
self-signed certificates.

Some daemon (exim4) need read access to the certs. In this case, it's possibile to use the special group ssl-certs
     adduser Debian-exim ssl-cert
     chgrp /etc/ssl/local/domain...
     chmod g+r /etc/ssl/local/domain...


For the record, at the moment (2014 April) it's recommended to rely only on
TLS and deactivate SSLv3, SSL2, etc.
